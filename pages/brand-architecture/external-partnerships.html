                When can an external partner logo be co-branded?
              </h2>
              <p>
                There are two situations when HCA Healthcare would co-brand with
                an external partner. The first is when a formal partnership has
                been formed with the external entity and the external entity has
                control of the co-branding hierarchy (e.g., co-branding with
                Apple). In that scenario, we defer to their guidelines.
              </p>
              <p>
                The second is a formal partnership with an external entity and
                HCA Healthcare has control of the co-branding hierarchy and thus
                is the priority brand. HCA Healthcare does not co-brand with our
                partners — therefore our logo should never appear with a
                partner's logo.

                Rules for external partnership co-branding where HCA Healthcare
                is the priority brand
              </h2>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  HCA Healthcare should always be to the left when locked up
                  with a partner logo.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Partner logo must not exceed the size of the <br />HCA
                  Healthcare logo.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Partner logo must be vertically aligned with the <br />HCA
                  Healthcare logo.
                </li>
                <li>There must be a clear divider separating both logos.</li>
                <li>
                  Always use the stacked version of the HCA Healthcare logo.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                As mentioned, we will not always have complete control in
                co-branding with external partners, but please request that the
                HCA Healthcare logo be on the left, equal in size to the
                partner’s logo and vertically aligned whenever possible. This
                will work toward consistency across external partnership
                materials.

              Our partners with actively signed contracts may use the HCA

              HCA Healthcare in text must be approved by the Communications and
              Brand Teams.

                There may be constraints when scaling a partner logo with the
